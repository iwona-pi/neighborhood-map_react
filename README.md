# Neighborhood Map React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
One-page application showing places on Google Maps. Clicking on the marker or list of the places causes displaying the infowindow with name of location and image from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.htm). Also added small animation like bouncing to know which one of the markers was clicked.
Filter locations using filter bar and you see markers dynamically rendered accordingly to location's name.
